# Starbucks Captone Project

## Project Introduction 

This is a capstone project for the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program of Udacity.  The datasets in the project simulated data of the Starbucks mobile app, which sends out different types of offers to their customers, such as an advertisement for a drink, a discount or BOGO. The goal is to combine transaction, demographic, and offer data to explore which demographic groups respond best to certain offer type and possible factors most related to offer usage.
